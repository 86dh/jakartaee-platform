# The correct name is "Jakarta EE"

The Jakarta EE platform is derived from the Java EE platform, which likewise was
[**never** abbreviated to "JEE"](https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/JEE).

Please, use only the correct name "Jakarta EE".  If that's too much to say
or type, call it "EE".  (No, not "double-E".)

Thanks.
