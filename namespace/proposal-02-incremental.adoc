# Proposal 2: Incremental Change in Jakarta EE 9 and beyond

Evolve API source from `javax` to the `jakarta` namespace over time on an as-needed basis.  The most active specifications would immediately move in Jakarta EE 9.  Every Jakarta EE release, starting with version 10 and beyond may involve some `javax` to `jakarta` namespace transition.

- The most active APIs would immediately move from `javax` to `jakarta`
- APIs not changed or determined by the community to be unlikely to change would stay in `javax`
- Jakarta EE 9 would be a mix of `javax` and `jakarta` packaged APIs
- If a change was needed to a `javax` API post Jakarta EE 9 for any reason, that API would transition from `javax` to `jakarta`.
- Jakarta EE 10 would be a mix of `javax` and `jakarta` packaged APIs, but a different mix than Jakarta EE 9.
- At some point down the road, Jakarta EE xx, it may be decided that the migration from `javax` to `jakarta` is "done" and the final APIs are moved.

Pros:

- Cheaper up front cost and reduced immediate noise.
- No need to move specifications unless there is an immediately visible benefit.
- Potential for less impact from API change overall.

Cons:

- Prolonged coordination, cost and complexity to industry affecting conversion tools, users, enterprises, cloud vendors, IDE creators, platform vendors, trainers and book authors.
- Use of restricted `javax` namespace prolonged.
- Frustration of "always changing" packages may deter application developers and become a permanent perception of the brand.
- Difficulty in remembering/knowing which Jakarta EE release an API was moved. "Is Connector `javax` or `jakarta` in Jakarta EE 11?"
- Difficulty in keeping the industry in sync.
- New implementations may find themselves having to deal with the `javax` to `jakarta` transition, unable to avoid legacy costs and therefore decide not to enter the space.
- Transitive dependencies to other specifications may make incremental change difficult or impossible.
- Restrictions on what Java SE implementation can be used for certification

Decisions:

- Do we start small or start large?
- Which APIs would immediately need to be changed?
