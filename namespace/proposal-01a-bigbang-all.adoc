# Proposal 1: Big-bang Jakarta EE 9, Jakarta EE 10 New Features

The heart of this proposal is to do a one-time move of API source from the `javax` namespace to the `jakarta` namespace with the primary goal of not prolonging industry cost and pain associated with the transition.

Were we to take this path, a compelling approach would be to do the namespace rename and immediately release this as Jakarta EE 9. Additional modifications would be put into a Jakarta EE 10 which can be developed in parallel, without further delays.

- Some or all Jakarta EE APIs under `javax` would move immediately into `jakarta` as-is.
- Any packages not moved from `javax` to `jakarta` could be included in Jakarta EE, but would be forever frozen and never move to the `jakarta` namespace.
- Jakarta EE 9 would be refocused as quick, stepping-stone release, identical to Jakarta EE 8 with the exception of the `javax` to `jakarta` namespace change and immediately released.
- Jakarta EE 10 would become the new release name for what we imagined as Jakarta EE.next with only minor impact on timeline.
- Work on Jakarta EE 10 could start immediately after rename is completed in the GitHub source and need not wait for the Jakarta EE 9 release to actually ship.

Pros:

- One-time coordination and cost to the industry, including; conversion tools, users, enterprises, cloud vendors, IDE creators, platform vendors, trainers and book authors.
- Easily understood rule: everything Jakarta EE 8 and before is `javax`, Jakarta EE 9 and after is `jakarta`
- Consistent with the `javax` to `jakarta` Maven groupId change.
- Highest degree of flexibility and freedom of action, post-change.
- Industry would have the opportunity to begin digesting the namespace change far in advance of any major new APIs or feature changes.

Cons:

- Largest upfront cost for everyone.
- Specifications that may never be updated would still likely be moved.
- Decision to not move a specification is permanent and therefore requires high confidence.

 Decisions:

- Which specifications, if any, would we opt not to move?
- Would we take the opportunity to prune specifications from Jakarta EE 9?
- Do we change the language level in Jakarta EE 9 to Java SE 11 or delay that to Jakarta EE 10?
