== [#50405432_pgfId-6959]##Introduction

[#50405432_pgfId-999128]## _T_ his specification defines the Java EE Web
Profile (“Web Profile”), a profile of the Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition specifically targeted at web applications.

===== [#50405432_pgfId-1001631]##Target and Rationale for the Web Profile

[#50405432_pgfId-1001635]##The Web Profile is targeted at developers of
modern web applications.

[#50405432_pgfId-1001933]##With the term “modern” we intend to highlight
the fact that the world of web applications has made much progress since
the introduction of the first Servlet specification. Inevitably, the
number of technologies used to create even simple web applications had
grown by leaps and bounds. In fact, few web applications today are
written directly to the servlet API: most applications rely on standard
or third-party frameworks and libraries, often developed as open source,
which in turn use the services of the servlet container.

[#50405432_pgfId-1001946]##Besides managing HTTP interactions, most web
applications have significant requirements in the areas of transaction
management, security and persistence. Such requirements can be readily
addressed by technologies that have been part of the Java EE platform
for quite some time, such as the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) 3.x
technology and the Java Persistence API, but that are rarely supported
by “plain” servlet containers. By incorporating many of these APIs, the
Web Profile aims at raising the bar for what should be considered a
basic stack for the development of web applications using the Java
platform.

[#50405432_pgfId-1001648]##Targeting “modern” web applications then
implies offering a reasonably complete stack, composed of standard APIs,
and capable out-of-the-box of addressing the needs of a large class of
web applications. Furthermore, this stack should be easy to grow, so as
to address any remaining developer needs.

[#50405432_pgfId-1001662]##Against this drive towards completeness, one
wishes to balance a desire to limit the footprint of web containers,
both in physical and in conceptual terms. From the point of view of
developers learning the Web Profile, it is more valuable to have a
small, focused profile, with as little overlap between technologies as
possible, rather than a more powerful but overly complex one, with
redundant APIs.

[#50405432_pgfId-1001692]##In defining the Web Profile we strove to find
a middle ground between these two sets of requirements.

[#50405432_pgfId-1001698]##In terms of completeness, the Web Profile
offers a complete stack, with technologies addressing presentation and
state management (JavaServer Faces, JavaServer Pages), core web
container funtionality (Servlet), business logic (Enterprise JavaBeans
Lite), transactions (Java Transaction API), persistence (Java
Persistence API) and more.

[#50405432_pgfId-1001699]##As for simplicity, it leaves out many of the
enterprise backend APIs that are part of the Java EE platform. It also
relies on the pluggability features in the Servlet specification to
allow applications to use libraries that extend the servlet container
with minimal configuration overhead.

[#50405432_pgfId-1001756]##Finally, it is worth reminding that Web
Profile products are allowed to ship with more technologies than the
required ones. It is conceivable that products will offer a choice at
installation time between different configurations, some richer in
extensions, or even allow for complete customization beyond the required
core (“à la carte” installation).

===== [#50405432_pgfId-1001707]##Determining Applicable Requirements

* [#50405432_pgfId-1001869]##

[#50405432_pgfId-1001867]##As dictated by the general rules for Java EE
profiles in the Platform specification, products that implement the Web
Profile must honor:

. [#50405432_pgfId-1001790]##all requirements of the Java EE Platform
specification that apply to all profiles;
. [#50405432_pgfId-1001820]##all requirements of this specification;
. [#50405432_pgfId-1001792]##all requirements of the individual
component specifications;
. [#50405432_pgfId-1001808]##all requirements in the Java EE Platform
specification that are conditional on the presence of a specific
technology or combinations of technologies.

[#50405432_pgfId-1001725]##Let’s look at some examples of requirements
from each grouping.

[#50405432_pgfId-1001822]##For the first one, the Java EE Platform
specification mandates support for the “ _java:_ ” naming context in all
profiles. Consequently, Web Profile products must support it. For a
similar reason, all Web Profile 8 products must support the Java
Platform, Standard Edition 8 API.

[#50405432_pgfId-1001823]##In the second category one can point out the
requirement to support Java EE web application modules ( _.war_ files)
(see link:WebProfile.htm#50405433_31324[See Additional Requirements]”).

[#50405432_pgfId-1001833]##The third category is hopefully
self-explanatory. For example, Web Profile products must implement the
Servlet API, which in turn means they need to satisfy all the
requirements listed in the Servlet specification.

[#50405432_pgfId-1001834]##The fourth category is the most complex. As a
first example, since a Web Profile product is required to implement the
Servlet technology, it must also follow all general requirements for
Java EE web containers in the Platform specification. Additionally, it
must follow all security requirements in the Platform specification that
pertain to Java EE web containers, all interoperability requirements for
such containers, etc. Furthermore, since a Web Profile product must
implement the Java Transaction API (JTA), it must also satisfy all the
Platform specification’s transaction management-related requirements for
web components, which indeed are conditional on the presence of Servlet
and JTA .

[#50405432_pgfId-1001726]##As a negative example for the fourth category
of requirements, consider the Java Message Service (JMS) technology.
Since it is not a required component of the Web Profile, Web Profile
products are not required to include an implementation of JMS, nor do
they have to support other JMS-related requirements, like the ability to
inject message destination references. On the other hand, a Web Profile
product that included an implementation of JMS would be required to
honor all the JMS-related requirements in the Java EE Platform
specification.

[#50405432_pgfId-1001978]##Particular care should be taken when
determining applicable requirements based on the presence of EJB Lite in
the Web Profile. As described in the EJB specification, EJB Lite is a
subset of the EJB API. When examining an EJB-related requirement in the
Java EE Platform spec, one must first of all determine which API
classes, component types and EJB container services are mentioned in the
requirement itself. Only if all of them fall inside the EJB Lite subset
that requirement is considered applicable to Web Profile products.

[#50405432_pgfId-1001988]##For example, since EJB Lite does not include
any remote functionality, the _EJB_ annotation may not be used to inject
a remote reference, something that should be kept in mind when
evaluating the requirements in the Platform specification section
“Enterprise JavaBeans References”.
